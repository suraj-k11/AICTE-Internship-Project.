📂 Garbage Classification using CNN
📌 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the AICTE Edunet Internship on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.
The goal of the project is to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies garbage into different categories, helping in waste management and recycling automation.

🎯 Objectives

Perform dataset preprocessing and exploratory analysis.

Build and train a CNN model for garbage image classification.

Apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance.

Evaluate the model using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix.

Contribute to sustainable waste management through AI/ML.
